Creating a dataframe
--------------------

The chunk below creates a dataframe containing a sample of size 10 from a random uniform\[0,5\] distributed variable, a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2, a (length-10) character vector, and a (length-10) factor vector.

``` r
# Setting seed for reproducibility:
set.seed(1)

prob1_df = tibble(unif_samp = runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 5), 
                  vec_logical = unif_samp > 2, 
                  vec_char = c("This", "is", "my", "first", "homework", 
                               "using", "R", "for", "data", "science"), 
                  vec_factor = factor(c("bad", "bad", "good", "mediocre", 
                                        "bad", "mediocre", "good", "bad", 
                                        "mediocre", "good"))
                  )
```

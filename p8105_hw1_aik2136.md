Problem 1

Creating a dataframe
--------------------

The chunk below creates a dataframe containing:

-   a sample of size 10 from a random uniform\[0,5\] distributed variable
-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
-   a (length-10) character vector
-   a (length-10) factor vector.

``` r
# Setting seed for reproducibility:
set.seed(1)

prob1_df = tibble(unif_samp = runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 5), 
                  vec_logical = unif_samp > 2, 
                  vec_char = c("This", "is", "my", "first", "homework", 
                               "using", "R", "for", "data", "science"), 
                  vec_factor = factor(c("bad", "bad", "good", "mediocre", 
                                        "bad", "mediocre", "good", "bad", 
                                        "mediocre", "good"))
                  )
```

### Taking the mean of each variable

A numeric vector will return a mean. The mean of the random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution is **2.7575694**.

``` r
samp_mean = mean(prob1_df$unif_samp)
```

A logical vector will return a mean, as values that are "TRUE" = 1 and values that are "FALSE" = 0. Averages can then be calculated for the translated numeric values. The mean for *vec\_logical* is **0.6**.

``` r
logical_mean = mean(prob1_df$vec_logical)
```

A character vector will not return a mean. Only vectors that are numeric or logical will return a mean. The mean for *vec\_char* is **NA**.

``` r
char_mean = mean(prob1_df$vec_char)
```

A factor vector also will not return a mean. Only vectors that are numeric or logical will return a mean. The mean for *vec\_factor* is **NA**.

``` r
factor_mean = mean(prob1_df$vec_factor)
```

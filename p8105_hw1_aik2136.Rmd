# Problem 1

## Creating a dataframe
The chunk below creates a dataframe containing a sample of size 10 from a 
random uniform[0,5] distributed variable, a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2, a (length-10) character vector, and a (length-10) factor vector.

```{r create_data_frame}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(1)

unif_samp = runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 5)
vec_logical = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, 
                  TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
vec_char = c("This", "is", "my", "first", "homework", 
               "using", "R", "for", "data", "science")
vec_factor = factor(c("less", "less", "greater", "greater", 
                        "less", "greater", "greater", "greater", 
                        "greater", "less"))

prob1_df = tibble(unif_samp, vec_logical, vec_char, vec_factor)


```


### Taking the mean of each variable
We will try to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe and see which variables return a mean value and which variables will not.

* Only numeric or logical variables will return a mean.
    + The mean for *unif_samp* is **`r mean(unif_samp)`**.
    + The mean for *vec_logical* is **`r mean(vec_logical)`**.  
* Character and factor variables will not return a mean.
    + The mean for *vec_char* is **`r mean(vec_char)`**.
    + The mean for *vec_factor* is **`r mean(vec_factor)`**.
